# Welcome
This machine learning course is created with Jupyter notebooks that allow you to interact with all the machine learning concepts
and algorithms to understand them better. At the same time, you'll learn how to control these algorithms and use them in practice.

## Lectures
Lectures can be viewed online as notebooks, as slides (online or PDF), or as videos (hosted on YouTube). They all have the same content.
Upon opening the notebooks, you can <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> launch them in Google Colab (or Binder), or run them locally.
